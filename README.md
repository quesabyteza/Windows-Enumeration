# Active Directory Enumeration Scripts

A collection of PowerShell scripts created by **Michael van Staden** for internal penetration testing and Active Directory enumeration. Each script targets a common AD misconfiguration or exposure vector useful in privilege escalation and information gathering during assessments.

---

## üîç Included Scripts

### 1. `Enumerate-SMB-Shares.ps1`
- Lists all accessible SMB shares on a target domain or host.
- Skips default administrative shares like `IPC$`.
- Useful for finding open shares with potentially sensitive files.

**Usage:**
```powershell
.\Enumerate-SMB-Shares.ps1 -Target TARGET_DOMAIN_OR_HOST
```

### 2.`Enumerate-Kerberoastable.ps1`
Identifies user accounts with SPNs set (Kerberoasting targets).

Helps locate accounts that can be attacked via offline TGS ticket cracking.

**Usage:**

```powershell

.\Enumerate-Kerberoastable.ps1
```

### 3. Enumerate-DomainTrusts.ps1
Lists all domain trusts and trust relationships.

Useful for mapping external trust exposure and lateral movement opportunities.

**Usage:**

```powershell

.\Enumerate-DomainTrusts.ps1
```

### 4. Enumerate-GroupMembership.ps1
Recursively lists members of critical domain groups like:

Domain Admins

Enterprise Admins

Administrators

Helps identify privileged users and group escalation vectors.

**Usage:**

```powershell

.\Enumerate-GroupMembership.ps1
```

### 5. Enumerate-DNSZoneTransfer.ps1
Attempts a DNS zone transfer against the current domain controller.

Uses nslookup to dump DNS records (if zone transfers are misconfigured).

**Usage:**

```powershell

.\Enumerate-DNSZoneTransfer.ps1
```
### 6. Get-The-Hash.sh

**Usage:**
Save as Get-The-Hash.sh
```terminal
chmod +x Get-The-Hash.sh
sudo apt install impacket-scripts smbclient (if not already installed)
./win-creds-remote.sh
```
Features
Menu-driven
Secure credential or hash input
Automates remote shadow copy and registry save extraction over SMB (using psexec.py)
Downloads files via SMB and dumps hashes locally
Guidance for Metasploit keylogging/hashdump
Cleans up after itself

üìÇ Repository Goal
This project aims to be a practical toolkit for penetration testers and red teamers focusing on real-world Windows Active Directory enumeration. Future additions may include:

Exploitation scripts (e.g. AS-REP Roasting, PrinterBug)

Post-exploitation tooling (e.g. token impersonation, privilege escalation)

Lateral movement helpers
